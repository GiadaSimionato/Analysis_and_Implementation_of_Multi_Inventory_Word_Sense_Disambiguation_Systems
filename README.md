# Analysis and Implementation of Multi-Inventory Word Sense Disambiguation Systems
Project repository of the third homework for the course of Natural Language Processing, Sapienza University of Rome.

This repository contains the Python implementation of the framework for data preprocessing and deep Multi-Inventory Word Sense Disambiguation system.
The implementation was based on the SemCord and Semeval2013 datasets. For more information, please refer to the report.

This work was completed on August 12th, 2019.
